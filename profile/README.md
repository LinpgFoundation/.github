# Hello, dear visitor! ðŸ‘‹

The **Linpg Foundation** is a non-profit organization passionately dedicated to democratizing game development. Our mission is to lower the barriers to entry for game developers of all skill levels and backgrounds, fostering an inclusive and vibrant community where innovation thrives. Founded with the goal of facilitating the development of the **Linpg Engine**â€”an advanced 2D game engine based on Pygameâ€”we've since expanded our vision to empower developers worldwide to bring their creative visions to life.

## About the Linpg Engine

At the heart of our initiatives is the **Linpg (Lin's Python Game) Engine**, a cutting-edge 2D game engine that simplifies and enriches game development. Built on the robust foundation of Pygame, it offers a suite of advanced features designed to streamline the creation process. Whether you're crafting intricate game worlds, designing compelling characters, or weaving complex narratives, the Linpg Engine provides the tools you need to succeed.

## Our Projects

The Linpg Foundation proudly supports and develops a range of open-source software and tools tailored for game development:

- **Linpg Engine:** An advanced 2D game engine that enhances and simplifies the game development process, making it more accessible and enjoyable.
- **VNS (Visual Novel Scripting):** A universal scripting language designed for creating rich and interactive in-game dialogues, bringing stories to life with ease.
- **Linpg Toolbox:** A comprehensive toolkit for managing, compiling, and uploading game projects, streamlining the development workflow.
- **A Story of Us:** A narrative project that showcases the capabilities of our tools and serves as a template for developers looking to tell their own stories.

## Supported Languages

We believe in the power of diversity, not only in our community but also in the tools and languages we support. Currently, our projects provide support for **Python** and  **C++**, catering to a wide range of developers and ensuring flexibility in how you bring your games to life.
